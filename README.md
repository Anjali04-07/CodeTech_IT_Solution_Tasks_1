Weather Data Visualization Using Python

In this task, we created a Python program to fetch and visualize weather data for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. The program integrates API data fetching and data visualization, demonstrating practical Python skills for handling real-world data.

The script first defines a list of cities and uses a personal API key to send requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. For each city, it retrieves key weather parameters including current temperature, “feels like” temperature, and humidity. The program includes error handling to ensure that invalid API responses or failed requests do not break the execution.

The collected data is stored in Python lists and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. Two charts are created: a bar chart comparing temperature and “feels like” temperature across cities, and a Seaborn bar chart showing humidity levels. The visualizations provide clear insights into weather patterns and are styled for readability using colors and labels.

This task demonstrates skills in API integration, JSON data handling, and Python plotting. It provides a beginner-friendly approach to building a mini dashboard, combining programming logic with data visualization techniques to interpret and present live weather data effectively.
